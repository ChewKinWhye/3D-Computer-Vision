    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement Zhenyou Zhangâ€™s camera calibration. \n",
    "The extrincs and intrincs of a camera are estimated from three images of a model plane. \n",
    "You will first estimate the five intrinsic parameters (focal length, principle point, skew) and six extrinsic parameters (three for rotation and three for translation) by a close-form solution. \n",
    "Then you will estimate five distortion parameters and also finetune all parameters by minimize the total reprojection error. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is worth **15%** of the final grade.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "This workbook provides the instructions for the assignment, and facilitates the running of your code and visualization of the results. For each part of the assignment, you are required to **complete the implementations of certain functions in the accompanying python file** (`lab2.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate implementation and grading, all your work is to be done in that file, and **you only have to submit the .py file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note the following:\n",
    "1. Fill in your name, email, and NUSNET ID at the top of the python file.\n",
    "2. The parts you need to implement are clearly marked with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \"\"\" YOUR CODE STARTS HERE \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\"\" YOUR CODE ENDS HERE \"\"\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    , and you should write your code in between the above two lines.\n",
    "3. Note that for each part, there may certain functions that are prohibited to be used. It is important **NOT to use those prohibited functions** (or other functions with similar functionality). If you are unsure whether a particular function is allowed, feel free to ask any of the TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "Upload your completed `lab2.py` onto the relevant work bin in Luminus.\n"
